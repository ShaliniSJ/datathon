Predictive Crime Analysis <br>
Problem: Crime patterns are often reactive rather than proactive, leading to resource strain and inefficient crime prevention.  <br><br>

Challenge: Utilize AI and advanced data analysis to predict high-risk areas for specific crime types, enabling targeted patrolling, resource allocation, and preventative measures. <br><br>

Problem Statement: <br>

Police generate and store a large volume of data relating to crime and criminals. However, the challenge does not end in storing and processing the data but in predicting crime hotspots, forecasting crime trends, and predicting offender characteristics. The problem includes identifying areas of specific crimes like murder, property offenses, and other bodily offenses and predicting future hotspots, using the data to predict when and where these crimes occur and also to link the pattern of crime with that of the offenders and predict the likelihood of future crimes based on demographic information and criminal history. <br><br>

 

Solution Expected: <br>

Spatial analysis of the crime, distribution of crimes over a particular location, and crime hotspots. <br>
Location-based analysis of the crimes, beat-wise distribution of crimes. <br>
Trend of occurrence of crimes at a particular time or in a particular day/ month/season of the year. <br>
Analysis of the accused age, occupation, socio-economic, status, location, etc, and prediction of criminal behavior. <br>
Analysis of the victim, socio-economic background, gender, location, and prediction of vulnerable populations and areas. <br>
Comparison of beat duties, patrolling areas with that of the crime occurrence, and analyzing the performance of the police <br>
Training an AI model that not only predicts the occurrence of crimes but also suggests a deployment plan for the police. <br>

## what are expected:
data model to analyse crimes, types of criminals, analyse victims, it should be able to predict crime hotspots, probability of occurance... and also relate with their resource allocation (how to utilise the efficient polic force), preventative measures  <br>

charecterstics of crime <br>
1. heiness and non heiness <br>
2. major heads and non major heads (attemt to murder with help of sharp objects) <br>
3. location <br>
4. date and time <br>
5. propety seized or stolen <br>
6. beat info <br>
7. description (normal murder or murder for gain) <br>

analyse the crime pattern, season date time etc. <br>

accused, victim(name, age, location, sex, nationality, language, description), witness (not necassary for all) <br>
socio economic conditions, behaviour of accused and victim <br>

location of rowdies commiting crime, their language, thier origin location, socio economic background <br>

must find co-relationship between different types of crime (like places where high occurance of murder, more theft, house bruglars..... is also a place for large no. of hurt cases) <br>

patrolling details and beat units details... (beat duty - resposible to prevent crime in the area of beat serving) <br>

co-relate crimes related to beat data <br>

AI model (MUST) - able to predict the crime, based on criminal present, time, it should alert the police abt the crime occurance, as well as guide them for optimum deployement) if there are 5 hurt cases registered in last 2 yrs at a particular location.... the number of beas served in the night is less... so model should suggest to put more patrol and beats. (it should also learn from the current datas and suggest optimum deplaoyment.... change/learn abt causitive factors)
